- coorespondence between measurements and features is known
- noisy data: median filtered (twice) off-line: `the data must be filtered'
- bundle adjustment (from SFM) is just a big optimization using observation and continuity:  reminds me of the CRLB trick
Assumes:
- known vehicle and _beacon_ depth
- no dvl (range-only)
- small movement during TOF
- uses Cauchy distribution
this is very off-line
- gives no guidance
- dimilar to SLBL and SFM

- the map this generates is ambiguious in X-Y and rotation!!!!
