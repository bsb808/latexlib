  Abstract                 = {<p>Cross-shore surfzone tracer dispersion in a wave driven alongshore current is examined over a range of wave and current conditions with 6 continuous dye releases, each roughly 1-2 hours in duration, at Huntington Beach, California. Fluorescent dye tracer released near the shoreline formed shore parallel plumes that were sampled on repeated cross-shore transects with a jet ski mounted fluorometer. Ensemble averaged cross-shore tracer concentration profiles are generally shoreline attached (maximum at or near the shoreline), with increasing cross-shore widths and decreasing peak values with downstream distance. More than a few 100 m from the source, tracer is often well mixed across the surfzone (i. e., saturated) with decreasing tracer concentrations farther seaward. For each release, cross-shore surfzone absolute diffusivities are estimated using a simple Fickian diffusion solution with a no-flux boundary at the shoreline, and range from 0.5-2.5 m(2) s(-1). Surfzone diffusivity scalings based on cross-shore bore dispersion, surfzone eddy mixing length, and undertow driven shear dispersion are examined. The mixing-length scaling has correlation r(2) = 0.59 and the expected best-fit slope \&lt; 1, indicating that horizontal rotational motions are important for cross-shore tracer dispersion in the surfzone.</p>

The difference between puffs and filaments is not well explained - seems hokey. Some questions that beg to be answered: - how to specify the boundary conditions for the advection term. - for the filament diffusion (2) it seems like there is some filtering, but then they just use white-noise?},

  Abstract                 = {Accurately quantifying total freshwater storage methane release to atmosphere requires the spatial–temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive emissions. Existing floating chamber techniques provide localised assessment of methane flux, however, significant errors can arise when weighting and extrapolation to the entire storage, particularly when ebullition is significant. An improved technique has been developed that compliments traditional chamber based experiments to quantify the storage-scale release of methane gas to atmosphere through ebullition using the measurements from an Optical Methane Detector (OMD) and a robotic boat. This provides a conservative estimate of the methane emission rate from ebullition along with the bubble volume distribution. It also georeferences the area of ebullition activity across entire storages at short temporal scales. An assessment on Little Nerang Dam in Queensland, Australia, demonstrated whole storage methane release significantly differed spatially and throughout the day. Total methane emission estimates showed a potential 32-fold variation in whole-of-dam rates depending on the measurement and extrapolation method and time of day used. The combined chamber and \{OMD\} technique showed that 1.8–7.0% of the surface area of Little Nerang Dam is accounting for up to 97% of total methane release to atmosphere throughout the day. Additionally, over 95% of detectable ebullition occurred in depths less than 12 m during the day and 6 m at night. This difference in spatial and temporal methane release rate distribution highlights the need to monitor significant regions of, if not the entire, water storage in order to provide an accurate estimate of ebullition rates and their contribution to annual methane emissions. },

  Abstract                 = {The ability of many animals and insects to track a plume to its source is a particularly impressive feat when the fluid dynamics is considered. Inspired by this observation this research seeks to identify the information in a passive scalar plume suitable for developing robust and efficient plume tracing algorithms. The subject of this study is a scalar plume emanating from a point source in a turbulent boundary layer which has been modeled in a laboratory facility built specifically for this purpose. A coupled PIV-LIF technique is used to measure the velocity and scalar field in a time resolved fashion. This data set is analyzed and the convergence rates of five single-point statistics, suitable as kernels of plume tracing algorithms, are investigated. The experimental data shows that the scalar fluctuations over long downstream distances from the source are characterized by filamentary structures that lead to relatively slow convergence rates for any statistic that is based on mean concentrations. The scalar intermittency, however, converges rapidly toward its true value, in fact converging to a testable hypothesis for source location direction faster than the time scale of the larger scale plume meander.PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  Abstract                 = {Turbulent odor plumes play an important role in many chemically mediated behaviors, yet the fine scale spatial structure of plumes has not been measured in detail. With the use of a newly introduced microelectro-chemical recording technique, we have measured, in some detail, the fine structure of an aquatic odor plume in the laboratory. We sampled a turbulent odor plume at 10 Hz with a spatial sampling area of 0.02 mm<sup>2</sup> approximately that of a chemoreceptor sensillum of the lobster, Homarus americanus. A 3-min record was sampled at 63 different sites in 3 dimensions (x, y, z). As expected from time averaging models, the mean values of pulse parameters such as height and onset slope were greatest near the source. However, what cannot be described by time averaging models is the instantaneous distribution of pulses: periodically high peaks with steep concentration slopes (well above the local average and far above predictions from averaging models) can be found far away from the source. However, the probability of above-average pulse heights decreases with distance from the source in x, y, and z directions. The most intense odor fluctuations occurred along the x axis (the cross-sectional center of the plume). Odor profiles were analyzed with three different models of sensory filters; logarithmic, probability, and temporal filters. This analysis indicates that features contained within the plume structure could be used as directional cues for orienting animals. It remains to be demonstrated that animals use such sensory filters to extract biologically relevant spatial information from odor plumes.},
