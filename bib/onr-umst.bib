  Abstract                 = {This paper surveys recent results in pursuit-evasion and autonomous search relevant to applications in mobile robotics. We provide a taxonomy of search problems that highlights the differences resulting from varying assumptions on the searchers, targets, and the environment. We then list a number of fundamental results in the areas of pursuit-evasion and probabilistic search, and we discuss field implementations on mobile robotic systems. In addition, we highlight current open problems in the area and explore avenues for future work.},

 anti-access as enemy actions which inhibit military movement into a theater of operations, and
area-denial operations as activities that seek to deny freedom of action within areas under the enemy?s
control.  A2/AD = China.
