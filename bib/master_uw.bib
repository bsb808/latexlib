- great overview and decomposition of the tracking problem for radar/sonar.  
- lots of techniques
- PDAF:  This just appends the probability of the measurement as it incorporated to the EKF.  It maintains only one hypothesis, but attempts to prevent overcomfidence in this measurment by multiplying by the probability of it's correctness.  It style makes a decision, it just includes a consequence of this decision instead of assuming it is the ONE correct measurment (which is what a nearest neighbor approach would do).
- the optimal bayesian approach for a single target is presented as evaluating all the possible measurment histories (exponentially increasing with time).  
- the suboptimal problem is then the N-scan back approach.  N=0 for the PDAF and N can be selected to balance the complexity and flexibility/precision/reliability.

- Despite Thrun's comments, this is a good paper.  It goes through many of the details of solving a version of the correspondence problem.  
- Building networks of relative poses (nodes) and transformations (links) using both odometry (weak) and scan matching (strong).  Formulates an optimality problem to find the maximum likelihood poses based on the incremental measurments and assuming gaussian errors.  Max. likelihood (minimum variance) reduces to least squares under linearity and gaussian assumptions.
- Method is general to the scan matching algorithm, i.e., it can utilize any matching algo. to find the incremental nav. information.
- Seems to be particular to scan matching where we can determine the amount of overlap between adjacent (both temporally and spatially) scans.
- The big drawback is that the approach is not real-time.  Each optimizaiton operates on the entire dataset.  They propose some simple fixes, but they are pretty weak.

Check ot Ghahramani's other work - he is great
Love the Calvin and Hobbes cartoons.
There seem to be many analogies to this paradigm of motor learning to what i'm currently thinking about in terms of learning for an AUV.  It is important to consider that what hypothesis gridding is about is about learning about the environment.  
Forward (predictive) models and Reverse () models. A model maps the sensor and actuator signals.  Feedforward control is essential form natural movement (you must have a forward model!). 
"Learning involves changes in behavioir that arise from interaction with the environment and is distinct from maturations."
Makes some statements about learning being necessary for robustness.
Learning on various time scales - individuals life and over generations.  This parallels the idea of learning over a mission, through multiple missions, and across multiple platforms. 
Types of learning: supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised.  Reinforcement learning is difficult (where there is no explicit objective funcion, only a good/bad binary feedback) because the inputs-outputs if the inverse model are one-to-many.  Also requires "temporal-credit-assignment" to decide which past actions contributed to the outcome (sensitivities).
Representation: Look-up tables, Basis functions, and Parametric functions.

One of the great  things about subsumption is that it is stable at its intermediate forms - a'la hierarchical design.  Each sub-system (behavior) is stable.  In classical AI the system is not stable until all the components are assembled (similar to Simon's watchmaker allegory).
- Mentions (and has a reference for) active vision - a subset of active perception?
- "the world is its own best model"
- ref. [26] - mobility as the necessary basis for the development of true intelligence.
- "Can there be a theoretical analysis to decide whether one organization for intelligence is better than another? [traditional or behavior-based AI] Perhaps, but I think we are so far away from understanding the correct way of formalizing the dynamics of interaction with the environment that no such theoretical results will be for the coming in the near term."

- trying to find "adequate theoretical justification"
- R.B. offers this analogy - the disconnects between physics, chemistry and biology are analogous to the disconnects between behaviors (micro), organizing behaviors (macro), and multiple robots (multitude).
" Choices in any part of the system architecture (e.g., sensor characteristics) have major impacts upon other parts of the system.  In general it is very dangerous to think that any one component (such as intelligence) can be isolated and studied by itself."
- Uncertainty in the data association problem (and data fusion) is greatly reduced if we through out the idea of objective world model representations and design behaviors that operate directly on the sensor data.  The creature does not need to maintain an estimate of uncertainty.
- Instead of having an objective world model, he advocates using a sensor based model.  Uses anecdotes of understanding an environment directly through the particularities of the sensor.  Our application is a bit different in that the primary task is to deliver an objective map of the environment!!!
- Advocates a sensor-based representation (vs. a target-based representation) - see Bar-Shalom's MHT for a similar debate in a much different context.
- Animal Ethology - the study of animal behaviors from a functional and causal viewpoint.
- Key Research Area: we do not have any analytic tools for understanding in advance what sort of conflicts and other unexpected interactions might arise from the ways we paste together behaviors using these methodologies.

This is a very heavy/thick treatise on the fundamentals of probability.

Very interesting discussion of the scientific method as induction and thus something that deduction can tell us nothing about.  Attempts to parallel Bertrand Russells Principia which evidently lays out the axiomatic bases for induction.  The concern here is for developing a consistent system for induction or inference based on observation.

Three competing fiels that use probability
1) Statistics - data only rejects hypotheses
2) Physics - data only proves hypotheses
3) Philosophy

THEME: Method for drawing inference from observation

Induction - Generalization - Learning
Deduction - Logic - Mathematics
 - not based on reality
 - sky hook model (simon?) - it is possible to build a logic without from the top down.  Assuming a starting point and hang a consistent system from that assertion.  
 - deduction only proves, disproves, or expresses ignorance.

This is just a fixed-lag smoother, but claims that sequential states need not be stored (i.e., 'important' past states can be appended to the state vector, not just the past n states).
- This is a good illustration of why you would want to do batch/real-time processing even if it not a particularly novel way of doing it.
- Defines stochastic mapping as the state-of-the art CML using nearest-neighbor techniques and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) - alla Smith,Self,and Cheeseman.
- Talks alot about feature initialization and partially observable features.  
- Doesn't talk about the improved localization based on future information, but that is not the focus.
- 'trajectory states' are the appended states.

- Good outline of the Bayesian Paradigm (2.1.2)

- age old criticisms: problems with non-informative likelihoods (not robust to priors), philosophical inconsistencies between ignorance and imprecision due to lack of information, and coherence (?)

- Sensor Fusion: Redundance vs Diversity and Complementarity

- Dempster-Shafer (Belief Theory): calls it non-probabilistic (this is not true). [209] [85] for sensor fusion. [203] comparison
  - non-informative priors (Bayesian) - main shortcoming.  Ignorance is equated with imprecision.  this is not too bad as long as the likelihoods are informative.
  - numerical sensitivity and overestimation problems [3]
- Bayesian robustness = informative likelihoods.

Three-Dimensional Computer Vision proposes solutions to problems arising from a specific robotics scenario in which a system must perceive and act. Moving about an unknown environment, the system has to avoid static and mobile obstacles, build models of objects and places in order to be able to recognize and locate them, and characterize its own motion and that of moving objects, by providing descriptions of the corresponding three-dimensional motions. The ideas generated, however, can be used indifferent settings, resulting in a general book on computer vision that reveals the fascinating relationship of three-dimensional geometry and the imaging process.

- goes through some basics of hyperbolic/spherical/time sync positioning.  works out a simple optimal path problem.  unsurprisingly the optimal path is to go into the center - uses simulated annealing :(
- arrival matching.  works through a 4 different methods to do matching.  the key is to find a matching technique that allows for dropped returns and parameter variation.
- he talks a lot about the multipath model (ray tracing), but where do you get the environmental model?  seems like a big problem.
- everything is done in simulation and the conditions of the simulation are never very clear.  
- wide-band/narrow-band filtering is explaned (good stuff for keeping the SNR despite the noise levels). 

- all and all, it seems to be pretty weak although i wouldn't tell anybody that.
