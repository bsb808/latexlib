  Abstract                 = {A large variety of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are currently under development or in production. In order for an AUV to be useful, its self-navigation capabilities must support the mission requirements. Often, underwater acoustic navigation techniques must be utilized in order to meet the navigational accuracy requirements. In addition to vehicle self-navigation, most AUV operators also require a method of tracking the vehicle while it is underway, so that its progress may be monitored, and also so that it may be located easily upon surfacing, or in the event of a vehicle failure. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) has developed a buoy-based system that simultaneously provides for both vehicle self-navigation and external tracking. This system has been used extensively by WHOI to support the REMUS AUV operations, and has also been used by the Naval Oceanographic Office to support sea-trials of the LAZARUS vehicle system. Long Baseline Acoustic Navigation is often the preferred subsea navigation method. It is generally accomplished by deploying two or more acoustic transponders, moored to the seafloor, near the desired area of operations. The vehicle then interrogates the transponders, determines its range to each, and finds its position using triangulation techniques. WHOI has developed a radio-controlled buoy, which can serve as a navigation transponder for the vehicle, and can also be commanded via the radio link to interrogate the AUV and report the measured travel time back to the operator. This paper describes the PARADIGM (Portable Acoustic RADio Geo-referenced Monitoring) system architecture, and presents data describing results achieved},

A complementary land-based expedition will be reported upon elsewhere. The 2000 underwater expedition had three research objectives: to search for evidence of human habitation prior to major flooding of the Black Sea that researchers predicted occurred some 7,500 years ago; to investigate a deepwater shipping route; and to search for ancient wooden ships in the sea's anoxic bottom waters. Research methods included the use of a phased-array side-scan sonar, a towed imaging sled, and a small remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to collect deep-sea survey data. Three shipwrecks and a probable site reflecting human habitation prior to the proposed flooding event were located at depths around 100 m. One additional shipwreck was found within the anoxic layer at a depth of 324 m. The ship found within the anoxic layer was intact, in a high state of preservation, and dated to the Byzantine period of 450 A.D.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1997, two shipwrecks were first discovered in the Mediterranean Sea west of Israel by the U.S. Navy's research Submarine NR-1. Further investigation in 1999 with the remotely operated vehicle system Medea/Jason found the wrecks to be from the eighth century B.C., the earliest known shipwrecks to be found in the deep sea. Both ships appear to be of Phoenician origin, laden with cargoes of fine wine destined for either Egypt or Carthage, when they were lost in a storm on the high seas. The ships lie upright on the seafloor at a depth of 400 m in a depression formed by the scour of bottom currents. Their discovery suggests that ancient mariners took direct routes to their destinations even if it meant traveling beyond sight of land.},

" Choices in any part of the system architecture (e.g., sensor characteristics) have major impacts upon other parts of the system. In general it is very dangerous to think that any one component (such as intelligence) can be isolated and studied by itself." - Uncertainty in the data association problem (and data fusion) is greatly reduced if we through out the idea of objective world model representations and design behaviors that operate directly on the sensor data. The creature does not need to maintain an estimate of uncertainty. - Instead of having an objective world model, he advocates using a sensor based model. Uses anecdotes of understanding an environment directly through the particularities of the sensor. Our application is a bit different in that the primary task is to deliver an objective map of the environment!!! - Advocates a sensor-based representation (vs. a target-based representation) - see Bar-Shalom's MHT for a similar debate in a much different context. - Animal Ethology - the study of animal behaviors from a functional and causal viewpoint. - Key Research Area: we do not have any analytic tools for understanding in advance what sort of conflicts and other unexpected interactions might arise from the ways we paste together behaviors using these methodologies.

  Abstract                 = {The problem of designing, implementing and testing a general-purpose guidance and control system for unmanned underwater vehicles for scientific applications is addressed in this paper. A three-level hierarchical architecture is proposed in order to uncouple the execution of user-defined motion-task functions with respect to the operating environment (guidance), from linear and angular speed control and mapping of the required control actions onto the actuation system. The introduction of PI-type task functions enables a conventional Lyapunov-based guidance system to counteract the effects both of unmodelled, i.e. unmeasured kinematic interactions between the vehicle and the environment, and of bias in velocity measurements. The vehicle dynamics are managed by conventional gain scheduling regulators performing velocity control, while an advanced actuator model, which considers propeller–hull interactions, improves the precision of the thrust to propeller rate mapping. Preliminary tests, carried out in a high-diving pool with an over-actuated prototype ROV, proved the system's functionality and showed high performances in terms of its precision in accomplishing near bottom slow motion tasks, e.g. altitude and hovering control and trajectory tracking, even when the mapping of the required control actions onto the actuation system is reconfigured to face any type of thruster fault. },

  Abstract                 = {In July 2000, an array of instruments called acoustic extensometers was deployed at the Cleft segment of the southern Juan de Fuca Ridge, a seafloor observatory site selected by the National Science Foundation RIDGE Program. These instruments are designed to precisely measure horizontal deformation across the axis of a mid-ocean ridge in order to detect and quantify seafloor spreading events. The instruments were deployed in semipermanent seafloor benchmarks in a linear array that is 1.2-km long and spans the floor of the axial valley. The instruments make daily measurements of distance to their neighbors in the array by recording the round trip travel time of 100-kHz acoustic pulses, and simultaneous temperature measurements are used to correct the ranges for sound speed variations. The instruments are expected to have lifetimes of at least five years. In addition, precise pressure measurements have been made at each benchmark with a remotely operated vehicle in order to monitor for vertical deformation across the array. Preliminary results show that the resolution of the acoustic measurements is ±1-2 cm and that no abrupt deformation events occurred during the first year},

  Abstract                 = {In 2001, C & C Technologies, Inc. of Lafayette, Louisiana began using the HUGIN 3000 AUV in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore oil and gas surveys. This new survey vehicle is faster, more accurate, and more maneuverable than conventional deep-tow systems and has raised the bar for deepwater geophysical and hydrographic surveys. Although archaeology was not the primary purpose for developing the vehicle, archaeologists are and will continue to benefit from its use. Archaeological investigation with a conventional deep-tow system is seldom conducted during industry surveys because of the cost and time involved in operating such a system. However, during the first year of operation with the HUGIN 3000, four shipwrecks were investigated as a result of the HUGIN’s cost effectiveness. The use of the HUGIN 3000 directly led to the discovery of the long sought after German submarine, U-166, which was located near its last victim, the passenger freighter SS Robert E. Lee. This AUV also helped document two additional newly discovered shipwrecks: The cargo freighter SS Alcoa Puritan and a small wooden sailing vessel known as the Mica wreck.},

  Abstract                 = { This work describes a framework for sensor fusion of navigation data with camera-based 5 DOF relative pose measurements for 6 DOF vehicle motion in an unstructured 3D underwater environment. The fundamental goal of this work is to concurrently estimate online current vehicle position and its past trajectory. This goal is framed within the context of improving mobile robot navigation to support sub-sea science and exploration. Vehicle trajectory is represented by a history of poses in an augmented state Kalman filter. Camera spatial constraints from overlapping imagery provide partial observation of these poses and are used to enforce consistency and provide a mechanism for loop-closure. The multi-sensor camera + navigation framework is shown to have compelling advantages over a camera-only based approach by: 1) improving the robustness of pairwise image registration, 2) setting the free gauge scale, and 3) allowing for a unconnected camera graph topology. Results are shown for a real world data set collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle in an unstructured undersea environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Operations with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have a variety of underwater applications. For example, a coordinated group of vehicles with environmental sensors can perform adaptive ocean sampling at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales. We describe a methodology for cooperative control of multiple vehicles based on virtual bodies and artificial potentials (VBAP). This methodology allows for adaptable formation control and can be used for missions such as gradient climbing and feature tracking in an uncertain environment. We discuss our implementation on a fleet of autonomous underwater gliders and present results from sea trials in Monterey Bay in August, 2003. These at-sea demonstrations were performed as part of the Autonomous Ocean Sampling Network (AOSN) II project},

Does NOT go into how to achieve, or approach, this performance goal. - Assumes a reliable environmental model - The problem is slightly different: to determine the depth and range (one, the other, or both) using the propagatin delay differences between multiple paths. - Has a nice shortcut for determining the CRB for guassian cases. - Deals with a variety of cases: one or two sources, one or two unknowns. - This is worth revisiting as a guide for showing the accuracy/precision of various techniques.

  Abstract                 = {For the past two years undergraduate engineering students from Olin College of Engineering have worked to develop unmanned surface vehicles as low cost educational platforms for scientific research. As an undergraduate project, the work on the USV involved the student team in a hands-on experience that included in-house design, fabrication, and field operations. Working dominantly out of the Olin Field Robotics Laboratory the first fully operational vehicle completed an unmanned field test in the spring of 2008. Previously in 2007, two students from this project team presented the academic benefits of this self-directed work for engineering and science education at the MTS/IEEE Ocean's Conference in Vancouver. Here we present the data collected from the first autonomous trials carried out by the vehicle as well as the continued work since the Oceans 2007 publication. This work includes the completion of the mechanical design, creation and verification of a mathematical model of the vehicle, and implementation of autonomous control. Lastly, this paper continues to testify to the core benefits of an unmanned vehicle as an undergraduate engineering project, leading not only a to viable vehicle platform but also an extremely valuable learning experience for the team involved.},

  Abstract                 = {This authentic multidisciplinary engineering project worked to develop an Autonomous Surface Craft (ASC) as a platform for scientific field research. The project served as a hands-on educational experience involving in-house design and fabrication and in-the-field operation. This sort of immersive engineering experience exemplifies Olin College's approach to engineering education. This project, focused around marine technology, is particularly effective for interdisciplinary undergraduate education. In addition, the engineering project stands within the larger context of marine studies and oceanography, making it more than just a pure engineering exercise. The goal of the project was to design, build, and field operate a surface vehicle capable of completing autonomous surveys, operated by small scientific teams without the use of specialized equipment. A student team designed the vehicle to carry a wide range of payloads both in terms of weight and power requirements. The team also strove to maximize the educational experience for the design team whenever practical. This goal led to custom construction, specific characterization laboratory experiments, and in-house software components. We present the final prototype, analytical laboratory results, and field data from multiple trials. These results illustrate how the design meets, and in some cases exceeds, the aforementioned design requirements. While this project is still very much a work in progress, the past year's work has already shown a positive impact on the undergraduate students involved. This sort of authentic engineering project focused in marine technology is ideal for undergraduate engineering students looking to learn by doing and gain valuable experience.},

  Abstract                 = {The relationships between the volume of a 4-satellite tetrahedron and the dilutions of precision (GDOP, PDOP, HDOP, VDOP, TDOP) have been frequently quoted and used in technical papers and discussions. The most commonly encountered statement concerning any dilution of precision (DOP) notes that it is approximately inversely proportional to this tetrahedral volume. A closer look at these algebraic, fractional expressions for DOPs shows that this statement is not correct due to the fact that even though volume does appear in the denominator of each DOP, the numerator is not a constant. Thus, some of the factors in the denominator can be cancelled with those same factors that appear in the numerator. The purpose of this paper is to use a sequence of simple arguments to arrive at an exact but complex, set of results which indicate the true relationship(s) between the various DOPs and the tetrahedral volume. Examples for special and limiting cases are also included for clearer illustration as well as to clarify misconceptions },

Attempts to parallel Bertrand Russells Principia which evidently lays out the axiomatic bases for induction. The concern here is for developing a consistent system for induction or inference based on observation. Three competing fiels that use probability 1) Statistics - data only rejects hypotheses 2) Physics - data only proves hypotheses 3) Philosophy THEME: Method for drawing inference from observation Induction - Generalization - Learning Deduction - Logic - Mathematics - not based on reality - sky hook model (simon?) - it is possible to build a logic without from the top down. Assuming a starting point and hang a consistent system from that assertion. - deduction only proves, disproves, or expresses ignorance.

The method is applicable for both ships and underwater vessels. We have used experimental data to build an underwater map and to investigate the estimation performance. Since the problem is non-linear, due to the measurement relation, we apply a sequential Monte Carlo method, or particle filter, for the state estimation. The fundamental limitations in navigation uncertainty can be described in terms of the Cramer-Rao lower bound, which is interpreted in terms of the inertial navigation system (INS) error, the sensor accuracy and the terrain map excitation. Hence, the Cramer-Rao lower bound can be interpreted and used in the design for INS systems, sensor performance or, if these are given, how much terrain or depth excitation that is needed for use in positioning and navigation.},

This paper focuses on performance improvements and analysis. First, the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) along the experimental trajectory is computed, which is only slightly lower than the particle filter estimate after initial transients. Simple rule of thumbs for how performance depends on the map and sensor quality are derived. Second, a more realistic five state model is proposed, and Rao-Blackwellization is applied to decrease computational complexity. Monte-Carlo simulations on the map demonstrate a performance comparable to the CRLB.},

Basically the procedure reduced the problem of assessing accuracy to that of calculating the moments and products of inertia of a simple mass constellation. This paper derives analogous results for range-range and range-sum multilateration tion systems. It also extends the results to take account of an independent position fix (e. g., barometric altitude). The new results have numerous uses. For example, the results make crystal clear the relative accuracies of the hyperbolic, range-range, and range-sum techniques. The results also make it easy to understand the salient accuracy characteristics of practical satellite-based and ground-based multilateration systems. Finally, the results provide a basis for deriving new bounds on the performance of range-range and range-sum systems.},

The results are applicable whenever the ranging errors can be treated as uncorrelated zeromean random variables. In some cases the bounds quantify general knowledge (e. g., the directional dependence of errors).

Max. likelihood (minimum variance) reduces to least squares under linearity and gaussian assumptions. - Method is general to the scan matching algorithm, i.e., it can utilize any matching algo. to find the incremental nav. information. - Seems to be particular to scan matching where we can determine the amount of overlap between adjacent (both temporally and spatially) scans. - The big drawback is that the approach is not real-time. Each optimizaiton operates on the entire dataset. They propose some simple fixes, but they are pretty weak.

  Abstract                 = {At the MIT Sea Grant College Program, autonomous surface craft (ASCs) have been under development since 1993. These systems have been designed for various missions and have demonstrated success in three separate iterations. The current goal of ASC research at MIT is to develop an easily deployed system that can serve as a tool for educational use, as a precision survey platform, and as a communications and navigation link to an AUV. In the past, this goal has been hampered by limitations in the mechanical design of the current system. Since September 1998 significant improvements have been made to the design of the current ASC. New power, propulsion, and control systems have been installed. These improve the performance of the vehicle and significantly reduce the mechanical and electronic failures that troubled the previous system. In addition, structural modifications have been made to make deployments and operations easier. These design improvements promise to make the ASC a more useful tool for, and provide greater service to, the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Laboratory at MIT. The paper briefly presents the history of ASC development at MIT. It then documents the design changes made to the current vehicle. The problems experienced with the old designs are identified and the improvements represented by the new systems are explained. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the next mission for the ASC},

Notably, our system does not require beacon positions a priori, and our system performs well even when range measurements are severely degraded by noise and outliers. We present a powerful outlier rejection method that can identify groups of range measurements that are consistent with each other, and a method for initializing beacon positions in an extended Kalman filter (EKF). We have successfully applied our algorithms to real-world data and have demonstrated a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system whose navigation performance is comparable to that of systems that assume known beacon locations},

  Abstract                 = {Robotic underwater vehicles are regularly performing vast optical surveys of the ocean floor. Scientists value these surveys since optical images offer high levels of detail and are easily interpreted by humans. Unfortunately, the coverage of a single image is limited by absorption and backscatter while what is generally desired is an overall view of the survey area. Recent works on underwater mosaics assume planar scenes and are applicable only to situations without much relief. We present a complete and validated system for processing optical images acquired from an underwater robotic vehicle to form a 3D reconstruction of the ocean floor. Our approach is designed for the most general conditions of wide-baseline imagery (low overlap and presence of significant 3D structure) and scales to hundreds or thousands of images. We only assume a calibrated camera system and a vehicle with uncertain and possibly drifting pose information (e.g., a compass, depth sensor, and a Doppler velocity log). Our approach is based on a combination of techniques from computer vision, photogrammetry, and robotics. We use a local to global approach to structure from motion, aided by the navigation sensors on the vehicle to generate 3D sub-maps. These sub-maps are then placed in a common reference frame that is refined by matching overlapping sub-maps. The final stage of processing is a bundle adjustment that provides the 3D structure, camera poses, and uncertainty estimates in a consistent reference frame. We present results with ground truth for structure as well as results from an oceanographic survey over a coral reef.},

In this model, the external forces and moments resulting from hydrostatics, hydrodynamic lift and drag, added mass, and the control inputs of the vehicle propeller and fins are all defined in terms of vehicle coefficients. The paper briefly describes the derivation of these coefficients. The equations determining the coefficients, as well as those describing the vehicle rigid-body dynamics, are left in non-linear form to better simulate the inherently non-linear behavior of the vehicle. Simulation of the vehicle motion is achieved through numeric integration of the equations of motion. The simulator output is then verified against vehicle dynamics data collected in experiments performed at sea. The simulator is shown to accurately model the motion of the vehicle. The paper concludes with recommendations for future model validation experiments},

This procedure can be carried out quickly and routinely to maximize vehicle effectiveness. A hydrodynamic model of the vehicle was first developed from theory and bench-top laboratory tests. Using this initial model, a controller was developed from basic principles. Then, using this initial controller to reach a desired typical operating condition, a very compact set of open-loop maneuvers was performed in the field. The vehicle model was optimized using the Nelder-Mead simplex method, and a revised controller was then implemented and tested successfully},

  Abstract                 = {Ad hoc localization of wireless sensor nodes is a fundamental problem in wireless sensor networks. Despite the recent proposals for the development of ad hoc localization algorithms, the fundamental behavior in systems using measurements has not been characterized. In this paper, we take a first step toward such a characterization by examining the behavior of error inducing parameters in multihop localization systems in an algorithm independent manner. We first derive the Crame Rao Bound for Gaussian measurement error for multihop localization systems using distance and angular measurements. Later on, we use these bounds on a carefully controlled set of scenarios to study the trends in the error induced by the measurement technology accuracy, network density, beacon node concentration, and beacon uncertainty. By exposing these trends, the goal of this paper is to develop a fundamental understanding of the error behavior that can provide a set of guidelines to be considered during the design and deployment of multihop localization systems.},

We illustrate the strengths of our design with data obtained during two research cruises associated with mapping coral reefs off Puerto Rico and Bermuda. In both these cases, SeaBED was deployed in extremely challenging terrain associated off the shelf edge and was successful in returning high quality color imagery of deep coral habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {The Ocean Engineering Department at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and the Naval Postgraduate have implemented AUV acoustic positioning systems based on the Desert Star Dive Tracker short base line (SBL) system. The motivation for these implementation efforts was to develop a short range, inexpensive, but relatively high precision navigation system for each institution's autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In the NPS case the SBL system is to support navigation of their Phoenix vehicle in mine reconnaissance type missions where the vehicle needs to more precisely locate obstacles and mine like objects. In the FAU case the SBL system is to support guidance of the Ocean Explorer (OEX) vehicle in rendezvous and docking maneuvers. The Dive Tracker SBL can produce supposed positioning accuracies on the order of 6" rms. FAU has build a portable easily deployed collapsible frame for supporting 3 SBL transducers or beacons. The frame is arranged in star that is anchored to the bottom. The baseline between transducers is approximately 20 ft. The OEX carries a transducer and electronics that compute its position relative to the baseline. A docking target placed near the baseline and anchored to the bottom. The location of the target is then determined by manually positioning the AUV transducer at the target and taking SBL fixes, A series of at-sea tests of this system have been conducted. This paper presents results of the at sea tests of this positioning system off the coast of Boca Raton Florida. The analysis will comment on the efficacy of this type of system for guidance of small AUVs in docking maneuvers},

The robot is inspired by the biological phenomenon of active electrolocation, a sensing strategy found in two groups of freshwater fishes known to emit weak electric fields for target localization and communication. We characterize the performance of the robot using several types of automatic electrolocation controllers, objects, and water conditions. We demonstrate successful electrolocation both in the conditions in which it is naturally observed, in low conductivity water, as well as in conditions in which it is not observed, in water of ocean salinity. The belief of the position of the target is maintained via a particle filter and refined with each measurement},

  Abstract                 = { Final conclusions have not yet been reached. However, it seems likely that the ship is a merchantman of around 40 meters in length that was either trading on the Norwegian coast or passing by. Using the unique new technology developed for this project it is possible to conduct mapping, surveying, sampling and excavation of shipwrecks in deep water. The Ormen Lange project is the most technologically advanced deepwater archaeology project, and first major deepwater archaeological excavation of a shipwreck that has been performed world-wide. The only comparable projects are treasure related salvage operations, but these cannot be called marine archaeology. In fact, this project shows that marine archaeology in deepwater can be carried out with purely scientific goals and without economic motives. 14 shipwrecks have been discovered in the pipeline routes. This clearly shows that the potential of deepwater archaeology is high. Marine archaeological investigations should therefore be an integral part of all industrial development projects in deepwater.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach to real-time trajectory generation for platoons of autonomous vehicles is developed from well-known control techniques for redundant robotic manipulators. The partially decentralized structure of this approach permits each vehicle to independently compute its trajectory in real-time using only locally generated information and low-bandwidth feedback generated by a system exogenous to the platoon. Our work is motivated by applications for which communications bandwidth is severely limited, such for platoons of autonomous underwater vehicles. The communication requirements for our trajectory generation approach are independent of the number of vehicles in the platoon, enabling platoons composed of a large number of vehicles to be coordinated despite limited communication bandwidth.},

The design of the hydrophone array is similar to that of conventional SSBL arrays, but uses greater inter-element separation to provide much better tracking accuracy. With this design, the bearing and elevation of targets at ranges greater than 10 km can be tracked with an accuracy better than 0.1 degree. Some applications of SSBL include: full ocean depth SSBL systems for ROV navigation and tracking; towbody tracking; integrated long baseline (LBL) and SSBL navigation; and long seismic streamer tracking. This paper discusses the design and performance of an integrated SSBL/LBL system that provides 0.1% slant range accuracy at ranges greater than those achievable using currently available SSBL tracking systems},

There seem to be many analogies to this paradigm of motor learning to what i'm currently thinking about in terms of learning for an AUV. It is important to consider that what hypothesis gridding is about is about learning about the environment. Forward (predictive) models and Reverse () models. A model maps the sensor and actuator signals. Feedforward control is essential form natural movement (you must have a forward model!). "Learning involves changes in behavioir that arise from interaction with the environment and is distinct from maturations." Makes some statements about learning being necessary for robustness. Learning on various time scales - individuals life and over generations. This parallels the idea of learning over a mission, through multiple missions, and across multiple platforms. Types of learning: supervised, reinforcement, and unsupervised. Reinforcement learning is difficult (where there is no explicit objective funcion, only a good/bad binary feedback) because the inputs-outputs if the inverse model are one-to-many. Also requires "temporal-credit-assignment" to decide which past actions contributed to the outcome (sensitivities). Representation: Look-up tables, Basis functions, and Parametric functions.

It style makes a decision, it just includes a consequence of this decision instead of assuming it is the ONE correct measurment (which is what a nearest neighbor approach would do). - the optimal bayesian approach for a single target is presented as evaluating all the possible measurment histories (exponentially increasing with time). - the suboptimal problem is then the N-scan back approach. N=0 for the PDAF and N can be selected to balance the complexity and flexibility/precision/reliability.
