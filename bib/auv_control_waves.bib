  abstract  = {Underwater vehicles operating near of the sea surface are subject to wave disturbances in their motion, severely affecting the quality of bathymetric maps obtained. This paper describes a controller structure for compensating the wave disturbances in the vertical plane for a torpedo-like Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), based on a modified version of the LQG/LTR controller methodology with a wave filter. The proposed methodology uses additionally to the classic LQG/LTR design the measurement of non-controlled states, such as the pitch rate and heave velocity, in the control action. The wave disturbances were filtered away by a shaping filter fitted to the sea spectrum, and the sensors signals were integrated by a extended Kalman filter. The proposed control methodology was tested against the classical LQG/LTR controller in a six degrees of freedom non-linear AUV simulator, producing a better performance in most demanding conditions, like high wave crests.},
