The overall objective of this thesis is to adapt the Second Generation Incremental
Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM2) algorithm [3] for use in multiple-AUV SLAM.
\\
\\One-way travel time (OWTT) is the most widely accepted model for acoustic
ranging in the field today [15]-[19].
\\
\\
Good lit. review of multi vehicle SLAM.
\\ \\ While our proposed approach will be most closely related to beacon-aided SLAM
operations, these approaches in the present body of SLAM literature are not appropriate
for this work because of our explicit consideration of tactical security
\\ \\ We formalize this
arrangement with application of Kullback-Leibler divergence
\\

Paull, Seto, and Leonard [45] report that
packet loss of 20?50% is not uncommon in this domain.

Impressive thesis - how do they get the students up to speed on SLAM.},

\\ \\
Reading between the lines, this sounds like a design thesis where there was lots of effort in setting up the experiment (modifying the Seafox USV).  
 \\ \\
EKF and UKF's - interesting comparision of computational time for different implementations.  Final comparison using dimensions of computation, accuracy and robustness - really nice summary.  
Multiple navigation state
estimators were designed using the extended Kalman filter and several variants of the
unscented Kalman filter. Each filter was evaluated against simulated and actual sea trial
data to determine its accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.
 \\ \\
I would like to thank David Purdy, Bill McAuley, and their support team from the
Port Hueneme Surface Targets Group for all the help and guidance in transforming the
SEAFOX II.
\\ \\
Lacking a truth model for data recovered from the SEAFOX II sea trials, a robust
simulation environment was used to evaluate and test each estimator. Condor: The
Competition Soaring Simulator is a commercially available flight simulator that
incorporates the use of a six degrees of freedom (6DOF) flight model and high fidelity
physics engine that operates up to 500 cycles per second [17].},
