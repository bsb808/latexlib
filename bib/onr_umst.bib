  Annote                   = {The problem formulation is fantastic.  They take a specific result from prior work, on the required conditions for the existence of stabilizing decentralized controller.  This general mathematical result is then applied to the specific problem that authors create.  The key result is that they show a decentralized controller exists to control a "platoon-level function" if the entire platoon can be told the value of the platoon-level function and its integral.

Brief discussion of "behavior based" vs. "system-theoretic" approaches to cooperative, decentralized control.

Assumes that the platoon-level function is measured by a single vehicle (or by an exogenous system).  A bit of BS here.  How could the system meausure the platoon-level funtion without communication?

For the example they also use prior work for the controller synthesis - using an "alternating projection approach".},
